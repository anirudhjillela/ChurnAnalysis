# ChurnAnalysis
# Introduction:
This repository gives an overview of the Python-based Churn Analysis project. Customer churn is the occurrence in which consumers discontinue utilizing a company's services or goods. Understanding and mitigating customer attrition requires firms to analyze customer turnover.

# Dataset:
This project's dataset is connected to the Telecom Industry.

# Content:
Dataset, EDA Notebook and Powerpoint Presentation.

# Project Overview:
In this project, we examine customer churn data to learn more about the causes of churn. Python is used for exploratory data analysis (EDA) and data preparation. The objective is to gather knowledge about the elements that influence customer attrition and to offer practical suggestions for lowering churn rates.

# To run the analysis, you will need the following dependencies:
- Python 
- Jupyter Notebook (for running the analysis notebooks)
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib and Seaborn (for data visualization)
- Scikit-Learn

# Analysis:
The steps in the analysis are as follows:
- Data Preprocessing: Cleaning the dataset, dealing with missing values, and encoding categorical characteristics.
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Visualizing and comprehending the properties of the data, investigating correlations between variables using both Univariate and Bivariate Analysis, and discovering probable patterns.
- Interpretation: Interpreting the outcomes of the investigation and identifying significant elements contributing to churn.

# Results:
The analysis's findings will include: -
- Visualizations that highlight the EDA's most important conclusions.
- Knowledge of the variables affecting client attrition.
- Suggestions to lower churn rates.

# Conclusion:
Senior citizens have a higher turnover rate of roughly 42%.

People on monthly contracts are the most likely to leave.

Fiberoptic service users have a high turnover rate.

Electronic check payments are the most popular.

People on two-year contracts are less likely to leave.

Males who do not have partners are more likely to churn (33%).

Females who use credit cards for payment are more likely to churn than males.
